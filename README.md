# Customer-Churn-Predictive-Analysis-with-Python-ML

## Project Overview and Problem Statement
Your client is PowerCo - a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to small and medium sized enterprises.
The energy market has had a lot of change in recent years and there are more options than ever for customers to choose from.
PowerCo are concerned about their customers leaving for better offers from other energy providers. When a customer leaves to use another service provider, this is called churn.
This is becoming a big issue for PowerCo and they have engaged BCG to help diagnose the reason why their customers are churning.

## Task 1: Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing
Determine the client data needed for analysis.</br>
Outline the techniques you'll use to investigate your client's problem. </br>
Write an email to your Associate Director summarizing your approach. </br>

## Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
Use python to analyze client data.</br>
Create data visualizations to help you interpret key trends.</br>
The client has sent over 3 data sets:
Historical customer data: Customer data such as usage, sign up date, forecasted usage etc. </br>
Historical pricing data: variable and fixed pricing data etc.</br>
Churn indicator: whether each customer has churned or not.</br>

## Task 3: Feature Engineering & Modelling
Use Python to build a new feature for your analysis.</br>
Feature engineering refers to:</br>
Addition</br>
Deletion</br>
Combination</br>
Mutation</br>
of your data set to improve machine learning model training, leading to better performance and greater accuracy.</br>
In context of this task, feature engineering refers to the engineering of the price and client data to create new columns that will help us to predict churn more accurately.</br>
Effective feature engineering is based on sound knowledge of the business problem and the available data sources.</br>

## Task 4: Findings & Recommendations
Build a predictive model for churn using a random forest technique.</br>
Write an executive summary with your findings.</br>
